Installation
============

Binary wheel install (recommended)
==================================

The recommended way to install MonetDBe-Python is using binary wheels distributed by pypi. For now, only OS X and Linux
are supported.

You need:

 * Linux or OSX 10.13+
 * pip >= 19.3
 * Python >= 3.6

For the non-binary wheel installation (Windows) you also need to have MonetDB installed.

.. code-block::

    $ pip install monetdbe


On supported platforms, this will download and install the Binary wheel, otherwise a source compile is started.

Source installation
===================

see the detailed online installation documentation for instructions to build from source:
